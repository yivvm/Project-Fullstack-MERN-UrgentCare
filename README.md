# Urgent Care Hub: Fullstack CRUD Operations with visit scheduling and managements

## Description

The Urgent Care Hub is a full-stack React web application designed to schedule appointments and manage visits for an urgent care facility. It provides functionality for creating, editing, and deleting patient visits, as well as viewing details of each visit.

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The backend communicates with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. On the frontend, React.js is utilized to create an interactive user interface to schedule appointments and manage visits, as well as to search and browse a directory of doctors and healthcare providers.

## Concept

One day, the thought crossed my mind: I wish I could use an urgent care facility which I could always access my medical records no matter where I go in the nation.
Perhaps I relocate and don't have a family doctor yet.
Perhaps I travel around the country.
I may travel to some locations on business trips.
Alternatively, I might visit my family, relatives and friends in different locations.
